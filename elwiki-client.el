;;; Commentary:

;; A very simple elwiki client for Emacs. Depends on creole-mode and
;; emacs-web.

;;; Code:

(require 'web)
(require 'creole-mode)

;;;###autoload
(defun elwikic (page)
  (interactive "Mpage: ")
  (web-http-get
   (lambda (httpc hdr data)
     (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create (format "*wiki-%s*" page))
       (let ((buffer-read-only nil))
         (erase-buffer)
         (goto-char (point-max))
         (insert data)
         (decode-coding-region (point-min) (point-max) 'utf-8)
         (creole-mode)
         (view-mode t)
         (visual-line-mode t)
         (goto-char (point-min))
         (switch-to-buffer (current-buffer)))))
   :url (format "http://localhost:8019/wiki/%s?raw=t" page)))
